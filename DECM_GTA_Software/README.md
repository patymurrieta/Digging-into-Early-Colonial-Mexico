# The DECM Geographical Text Analysis Software -COMING IN 2022!

## What you will find here
The GTA software developed in two beta versions (v.1 and v.2) combine concepts from Corpus Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, and Geographic Information Systems. Our research group first developed the idea at Lancaster in the context of the Spatial Humanities project (see [Murrieta-Flores et al., 2015](https://www.academia.edu/5897837/Automatically_analysing_large_texts_in_a_GIS_environment_The_Registrar_Generals_reports_and_cholera_in_the_nineteenth_century_)). A detailed description of the method as implemented in the software can be found in [Jiménez-Badillo et al., 2021](https://www.academia.edu/66411222/An%C3%A1lisis_hist%C3%B3rico_geogr%C3%A1fico_de_documentos_novohispanos_del_siglo_XVI_mediante_t%C3%A9cnicas_de_ling%C3%BC%C3%ADstica_computacional_y_an%C3%A1lisis_espacial)., [Murrieta-Flores et al., 2022](https://www.academia.edu/82973569/Artificial_Intelligence_Computational_Approaches_and_Geographical_Text_Analysis_to_Investigate_Early_Colonial_Mexico)., and Murrieta-Flores et al., 2023-forthcoming. The method involves applying Geographic Collocation Analysis. The software combines an interface with a corpus viewer, a query interface, and a keyword in-context tool connected to a map explorer and a historical gazetteer. The tool identifies concepts and/or terms and their associations to places with their coordinates in very large corpora, allowing to explore the corpus in different ways and download the results for further analysis in Geographic Information Systems or other tools. 

In the current version, the software works by uploading an annotated corpus and bringing a historical gazetteer through an API. We are still developing the tool to open it to other users so everyone can work with their own tailored annotated corpora and gazetteers or bring a geographic index from projects such as the World Historical Gazetteer. At the moment, a demo with a sample of the corpus of the Relaciones Geográficas can be explored here: https://gta.colonialatlas.com/v2

## Project information: 
The Digging into Early Colonial Mexico: A large-scale computational analysis of 16th century historical sources project uses part of the corpus known as Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España – one of the most important colonial historical sources of America – concerned with the territory of Mexico, to create and develop novel computational approaches for the semi-automated exploration of thousands of pages contained in these 16th century documents.

Tackling important historical and methodological questions, and highly demanding challenges in the study of these written sources, we are extracting, analysing, and visualising information that can improve our understanding of this period, and expedite the process by which we study these documents.

Our highly interdisciplinary team is combining techniques from different disciplines, including Corpus Linguistics, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Geographic Information Systems, to address questions related to the recording of information about indigenous cultures, the Spanish exploration of indigenous social and religious concepts, the appropriation and ideas about place and space in the indigenous world, and their attitudes towards politics and economy.
