# The DECM Corpus

## What you will find here
The DECM Corpus is a digital corpus produced from the original editions of the texts of the Relaciones Geográficas with different versions. These include a machine-ready version, a machine learning annotated training dataset, and an automatically annotated version ready for text mining and machine learning experiments.

### Contents:
``` 
1. The DECM Machine Ready Corpus: 
	This version includes text only files (.txt) containing each of the 10 volumes originally edited by 
	Rene Acuña, the 2 volumes edited by Mercedes de la Garza, the Suma de Visita edited by Del Paso y 
	Troncoso, a file with the original text of the Crown mandate (Instrucción), and metadata for this 
	collection. This version contains only the original text of each of the RGs as transcribed by the 
	scholars, excluding any editorial note, commentary, or historical work. This can be therefore used 
	directly for corpus linguistics analyses, visualisations, etc.

2. The DECM Gold Standard Corpus: 
	This version contains a sample of the RGs manually annotated by multiple researchers with the 
	software of our industry partner, Tagtog. This corpus has been used to carry out the NLP and ML 
	experiments and the files are available in JSON and TSV format. These files are composed by texts 
	and annotations. This is also accompanied by the DECM ontology which provides an explanation of the 
	entities and labels produced. This corpus can be used for further experimentation with Artificial 
	Intelligence methods.

3. The DECM Machine Annotated Corpus: 
	This is the version of the entire RG corpus automatically annotated using the ML models trained with
	the DECM Gold Standard Corpus. The files are available in JSON and TSV format, and it also contains
	the file for the DECM Ontology. This corpus can be further used for quantitative and qualitative 
	research, as well as advanced analyses using text mining techniques, corpus linguistics and other 
	methods such as Geographical Text Analysis. 

4. The DECM Ontology and Annotation Rules:
This .xls file contains two sheets. The one called 'Ontology' defines the entities and labels used to annotate 
the corpus of the RGs. This comprises 18 entities and labels marking important social, political, territorial, 
religious, and economic information. The second one, called 'Annotation rules' includes the basic rules followed 
by all the annotators in the project and examples that help to make decisions while carrying out the annotations. 
These rules were thought to achieve a better annotator consensus which in some cases reached up to 98 per cent 
in some entities.

## Project information: 
The Digging into Early Colonial Mexico: A large-scale computational analysis of 16th century historical sources project uses part of the corpus known as Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España – one of the most important colonial historical sources of America – concerned with the territory of Mexico, to create and develop novel computational approaches for the semi-automated exploration of thousands of pages contained in these 16th century documents.

Tackling important historical and methodological questions, and highly demanding challenges in the study of these written sources, we are extracting, analysing, and visualising information that can improve our understanding of this period, and expedite the process by which we study these documents.

Our highly interdisciplinary team is combining techniques from different disciplines, including Corpus Linguistics, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Geographic Information Systems, to address questions related to the recording of information about indigenous cultures, the Spanish exploration of indigenous social and religious concepts, the appropriation and ideas about place and space in the indigenous world, and their attitudes towards politics and economy.
