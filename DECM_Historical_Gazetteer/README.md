# The DECM Historical Gazetteer

## What you will find here
The DECM Historical Gazetteer is a digital gazetteer of historical places in Mexico available in different formats and built from detailed research. This includes a 16th century version (*The DECM 16th Century Gazetteer*) with the toponyms mentioned in primary sources including the Relaciones Geográficas (1577-1585) and the Suma de Visitas de los Pueblos de la Nueva España (1548-1550), as well as information on the political, religious and administrative units of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. 
The gazetteer is composed of 71 files with geographic information of colonial provinces, alcaldias, corregimientos, diocesis, among many others, as well as thousands of historical cities, towns, villages, and other places. This is integrated in an interoperable model containing thousands of historical locations with alternative spelling place-name variations. The dataset also includes 40 tables with additional historical information related to toponyms, languages, repositories, maps, etc.

### Contents:
``` 
1. The DECM Gazetteer: 
	This version includes all the researched historical toponyms contained in primary and secondary sources and it can 
  be provisionally consulted here: <link>. The information is organised by RG volume. It also includes layers and tables 
  of historical information digitised and/or created by the project from secondary sources. All is accompanied by 
  metadata, including the DECM Gazetteer Registry. 
This set is composed by: a) all toponyms with coordinates, mentioned and disambiguated from the edited collections of the RGs and 
from secondary sources as specified below; b) 30 geographical layers of additional historical information derived from secondary sources; 
c) 32 tables with other important historical information related to the RGs; d) a table with the percentages of disambiguation achieved 
for each volume; e) the DECM Gazetteer Registry; f) a text file with the sources used for disambiguation; and g) a README file with all 
information on the dataset.
  
2. The DECM 16th century Gazetteer:
	This version constitutes a subset of the main DECM Historical Gazetteer, including only the toponyms that were 
	mentioned in the RG reports and the Suma de Visita de los Pueblos, providing a precise window into the period 
	when these were recorded (1548-1550/1577-1585). 
	This dataset contains: the toponyms with coordinates, mentioned and disambiguated for each RG volume and the Suma; 
	plus, the 30 geographical layers and 32 tables as explained above, as well as the DECM Gazetteer Registry. 


3. The DECM Gazetteer Registry:
	This is a record for quick reference of all the files available in the Gazetteer.

## Project information: 
The Digging into Early Colonial Mexico: A large-scale computational analysis of 16th century historical sources project uses part of the corpus known as Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España – one of the most important colonial historical sources of America – concerned with the territory of Mexico, to create and develop novel computational approaches for the semi-automated exploration of thousands of pages contained in these 16th century documents.

Tackling important historical and methodological questions, and highly demanding challenges in the study of these written sources, we are extracting, analysing, and visualising information that can improve our understanding of this period, and expedite the process by which we study these documents.

Our highly interdisciplinary team is combining techniques from different disciplines, including Corpus Linguistics, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Geographic Information Systems, to address questions related to the recording of information about indigenous cultures, the Spanish exploration of indigenous social and religious concepts, the appropriation and ideas about place and space in the indigenous world, and their attitudes towards politics and economy.
