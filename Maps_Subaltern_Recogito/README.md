# The Subaltern Recogito Project

## What you will find here
The Subaltern Recogito Project was developed with a Pelagios Commons Resource Development Grant to explore the annotation of a series of historical maps using Recogito. Our corpus of maps includes those produced in the sixteenth century for the Relaciones Geográficas de Nueva España across the area, which is currently Mexico. The project took place in collaboration with our colleagues in the LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections at The University of Texas at Austin, the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH), The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), and the University of Lisbon. We delivered an online workshop and trained participants on Recogito for the annotation of the sixteenth-century maps of the Relaciones Geográficas.

Twenty-seven scholars from UNAM and ENAH participated, and Patricia Murrieta-Flores introduced the Spatial Humanities and the use of these technologies. From this, the project evolved into a citizen science project, where the participants met online every week to participate in ‘mappathons’, completing the annotation of a set of sixteenth-century maps now available in the Benson collection.

## Project information: 
The Digging into Early Colonial Mexico: A large-scale computational analysis of 16th century historical sources project uses part of the corpus known as Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España – one of the most important colonial historical sources of America – concerned with the territory of Mexico, to create and develop novel computational approaches for the semi-automated exploration of thousands of pages contained in these 16th century documents.

Tackling important historical and methodological questions, and highly demanding challenges in the study of these written sources, we are extracting, analysing, and visualising information that can improve our understanding of this period, and expedite the process by which we study these documents.

Our highly interdisciplinary team is combining techniques from different disciplines, including Corpus Linguistics, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Geographic Information Systems, to address questions related to the recording of information about indigenous cultures, the Spanish exploration of indigenous social and religious concepts, the appropriation and ideas about place and space in the indigenous world, and their attitudes towards politics and economy.
